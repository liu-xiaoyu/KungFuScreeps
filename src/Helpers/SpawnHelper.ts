            Potentially, we could check that the room state is within a certain value range
            like advanced, stimulate, seige, maybe? (same values its changed on anyway, so just extra saftey)
            And we could like check if any empire jobs exist... still not sure the route we're going to take
            to make sure terminals and labs get filled exactly, but we do know that those will create room jobs
            for creeps to follow, we could also have it fill another memory structure and we check that and
            decide how many lorries we need to do this set of jobs, it also has the benifit of slowly going down
            as the job is more and more complete ie if we spawn 1 lorry per 25k energy we want to move to a terminal,
            then as the amount of energy needing to be moved remaining goes down, naturally the number of lorries needed
            will as well.

            I'm having a flash of an idea about empire job queues. Each room can check empire job queues and decide if they
            need to create any jobs in the room, and this function for example will check how many lorries need to exist in the room
            etc, etc, etc. We can see what way we wanna go there, we still are a little bit off from that since we need to finish
            the more pertinant parts of job queues and set up the flag system and make sure the room structures run themselves (thats
                when we actually start running into it, since terminals will presumably check this emprie job queue and decide if it needs
                to sell energy, move to another room)

            It would also be interesting to set up a system to supply each other with energy as needed. Like if you're being seiged and in real trouble
            and you're running dry (lets say they've knocked out a couple of your other rooms too) i could send energy and help keep your
            last room alive... possibly military support to would be really cool (that would be as simple as detecting and auto placing a flag
                in your room and the system will handle itself)

            Even more off-topic, but we make sure creep.attack() and tower.attack() is never called on an ally creep (maybe even override the functions)
            (to ensure extra saftey in the case of abug)
